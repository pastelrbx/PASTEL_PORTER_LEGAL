## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Pastel Porter** (the “Bot”), which is operated by **Pastel Software** (“we,” “our,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information when users (“you,” “your,” or “user”) interact with our Bot on Discord and through associated features (like logging events or uploading content to Roblox).

## 2. Information We Collect

1. **User-Provided Information**  
   - **Attachments and Content:** When you upload files (e.g., `.zip` texture packs), the Bot processes them to create or alter texture packs.  
   - **Discord User Information:** Discord may share certain information with us when you interact with the Bot. This includes your username, user ID, server ID, and any messages you send to the Bot.

2. **Automatically Collected Information (Logging)**  
   - **Logs:** When you use commands, the Bot may store logs of your actions (which may include user IDs and timestamps) for moderation, debugging, or security purposes.  
   - **Roblox Upload Logs:** If the Bot uploads any data to Roblox, it may record what was uploaded and by which user ID, in order to enforce content guidelines and maintain a record for moderation.

   - We use logs and uploaded attachments to identify inappropriate or malicious content and may take action (such as blacklisting users) in accordance with our Terms of Service.

3. **To Upload to Roblox**  
   - The Bot may upload user-provided content to Roblox, provided the content meets Roblox’s and our own content requirements.
